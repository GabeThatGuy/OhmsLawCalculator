# OhmsLawCalculator
An Ohm's law calculator coded in c# for Windows devices.
## Intro
Hey, thanks for stopping by. I havent compiled this yet so source code is all you've got for now.

The Calculator features 3 modes for calculating certain parameters. The calculator requres 2/3 pieces of data.

For example: if you want to calculate the resistance of a wire, you MUST have the voltage and current values.
Then, you can select the resistance mode in the calculator and you're set.

## How to use the memory function

So, you wanna know how to use the memory function. I got you:
First, either type in some data, or complete a calculation. 
Then hit the STO button to save your data into the memory. You'll see it on the right side of your window. 
Once you've got the data saved, you can click the RCL button on any of the other fields (or the same one if you like wasting time) and see the stored data there. This is mainly used for numbers with massive decimals, since you probably don't want to sit there typing out 8 decimal points for every single calculation

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any problems with the code or the app, you should get an error message telling you something went wrong. If the data you entered was for sure correct, feel free to reach out to me via the issues tab and I'll do my best to give you a hand.

Happy calculating!
